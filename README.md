## Big Picture

1. Problem Statement
   - Welcome to Machine Learning Housing Corporation!
   -  Organiazationa Objective: Replacing expensive, time consuming and less effective manual prediction technique with Machine Learning.
  
2. Framing the problem
   - Data: California Census Data 
   - A typical Univariate Multiple Regression task.
   - Training Set is labelled hence "Supervised Learning".
   - Data is small hence we shall opt for "Batch Learning".

2. Performance Measure
   - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) - l<sub> 2 </sub> Norm
   - Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) - l<sub> 1 </sub> Norm

## No Data Snooping
