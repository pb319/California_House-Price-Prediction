# California_House-Price-Prediction
This is going to be my first end to end ML project implementation covering all required stages taking guidence from book called "Hands On Machine Learning"

## Big Picture

1. Problem Statement
   - Welcome to Machine Learning Housing Corporation!
   -  Organiazationa Objective: Replacing expensive, time consuming and less effective manual prediction technique with Machine Learning
  
2. Framing the problem
   - Data: California Census Data 
   - A typical Univariate Multiple Regression task.
   - Training Set is labelled hence **"Supervised Learning"**
   - Data is small hence we shall opt for **"Batch Learning"**

2. Performance Measure
   - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) - l<sub> 2 </sub> Norm
   - Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) - l<sub> 1 </sub> Norm

## No Data Snooping

1. Get the Data
   - Overview and Primary Understanding .
2. Test Set
   - Firstly employed **Simple Random Sampling** to draw a test & tarin set using `Scikit- Learn`
   - Sencondly utilized **Stratified Sampling** by categorizing the whole datase on `median_income`
   - Later we compared **Sampling Bias** from both the sampliing techniques


## Exploratory Data Analysis

- Creating Viualizations
